      <h4>Red Eye Removal&nbsp;</h4>
      
      <p class="text_column">This is the first of my many photoshop skills that I have completed, it was a pretty easy thing to do, but I and my dad gave it a complicated answer, as shown in the next image. .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <h4>Blue eyes fixed.&nbsp; &nbsp;</h4>
      <p class="text_column">this image took us probably 3 hours to create. and is made out of hundreds of failed attempts. but was well worth it in the end, as I was well introduced to many shortcuts, tips, and ideas, that would prove useful for future practice.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

      <h4>Under Exposed Photo&nbsp;</h4>
      
      <p class="text_column">This photo is very poorly lit, so we used a mix of saturation, opacity, shadows and highlights to create an image that resembled midday with mixed results.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <h4>Lightening a Photo&nbsp;</h4>
      <p class="text_column">the foreground and sky are on two different layers, so we had to find the correct lightness for both layers, leaving an annoying line in the photo.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="text_column">this photo was fairly easy to do, it only took a bit of curve tool, and brightness and contrast changing to make the image look quite good.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="text_column">&nbsp; in this tas, we had to create a soft-focus effect, which I did on the other page.    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="text_column">This task was very easy to do and did not take too much effort, it was unfortunate, however, that my original work got deleted due to the fact that I am unable to use the full extent of my brain. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <h4>Dark Forest&nbsp; &nbsp;</h4>
      <p class="text_column"> I used the font "Blair Caps." for this task to sell the fact that it was a dark forest, and made the color similar to that found on the left side of the image.. </p>

Then I got all of the text onto the image and selected a font to represent a minimalist cover, that seemed sophisticated. Then I got the other items that you see on a DVD and slapped it all together nicely.</p>

	  <p align="center">In this task, we were to recreate a menu for a restaurant called "Dexters" which proved to be more challenging than I predicted, resulting in a day-long task that should have been completed in a few hours if I chose to be more productive and retained the knowledge that my dear father had passed onto me. I used Adobe Illustrator for creating this task and instead of opting for the easy route, my dad had given me the idea to instead place all of the items on the menu on a template, and slap on images later. the menu copying quickly became a grueling task as I was unable to copy-paste the text. unfortunately, however, I didn't actually add or use photoshop to complete this task, but I DID however create a menu using the proper software that a creator may do, so, you can grade me however may be needed. </p>

 <p algn=center>For this task, we were instructed to fill out sone audio tasks, of which I tried to do, with varying results. The first one wasn't very clear, so I did all of what was instructed, but you can't tell, as it is an audio file. for the second one, I followed to the extent that I could, resulting in what you ave listened to. as for the third one, it was corrupted resulting in garbage file, for lack of a better term, so, I suppose you will just have to trust that I did the first and third tasks. I have dubbed these two tasks "car noises." and "chid sings" respectively.&nbsp;</p>

<p> This task was the most fun task, that I chose to complete really poorly, not learning anything from completing this task. we were instructed to make a video out of three smaller videos and add some nice music to the background, to make it pleasing. My video is called "Man Cracks Two Eggs Into a Bowl and Disposes Them to the Tune of Famous Queen Song "Another One Bites the Dust"". I created this artwork using adobe Aftereffects, wasting its potential, with what I have created.

	<p> in summary, I apologize for my lacking efforts in creating this website. I feel as though I cloud have and indeed SHOULD HAVE created something better with the resources and time available, but I failed that task with my lacking work ethic ad overall incompetence, and for that I a humbly sorry. while I do know that it isn't the end of the world if this task isn't up to the extent that it should be, I still feel ashamed for doing what I feel, is a half-assed job. so, I hope you enjoyed observing my website. I shall see you back at school.
